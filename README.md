# Holiday_Schedule_M07_Assessment_Dalton_Bode
The holiday schedule program allows users to check up on what holidays are coming up later in the current year, 2 years into the future, and what holidays occurred 2 years ago. 
Users can add holidays, remove holidays, and view holidays for any week from two years in the past, the current year, and 2 years in the future. 
If they want to save changes midway through a session, that can do so in the main menu, and the contents will be saved to a JSON file. 
If they want to exit the program and the user hasn't saved changes made to the file, the user will be prompted on whether they would like to save the changes or not before exiting the program. If there weren't any changes to the file, the user will not be prompted and will automatically quit out of the program.
